## üí° Object-Oriented Principles Applied

- **Encapsulation**: Each class (e.g., `Member`, `Book`, `LibraryService`) handles its own data and behaviors.
- **Abstraction**: Users interact only with the interface, not the internal logic.
- **Inheritance and Polymorphism** are prepared for but not deeply used due to the project‚Äôs scope.
- **Separation of Concerns**: Logic, UI, and data models are kept in separate files for clarity and maintainability.

## üßÆ Use of Math

- Calculates the number of days since a book was borrowed using `DateTime.Now - BorrowedDate`.
- Automatically flags books as overdue if the borrowing period exceeds 14 days.
- Generates sequential member IDs and book IDs.
